# Hi, I'm Kieran 

Hi I'm a Front-End Developer and a current student on The School of Code‚Äôs 16-week intensive BootCamp. 

Before beginning my journey into Tech I was an English Teacher for 9 years working in over 6 countries. I am now hoping to make a career pivot into the exciting world of tech.

<!-- ### About me

- I began coding during the COVID lockdown and quickly fell in love with it after I managed to center my first div. Since then I have been on an exciting learning journey full of exhilarating peaks and character-building troughs (cant't have one without the other). I am proud of my resilience, grit and determination. I always show up and put in my best effort every day. I understand that consistency is key, as two or three baby steps each day will soon add up to giant gains over time. 

- I work well in a team and I feel that a lot of the skills I have learned during my teaching career are relevant to working in a tech team. I can create a warm, supportive and friendly atmosphere to work, learn and play in. 

- During my time at the School of Code I have really loved the joys of sharing the wins and small triumphs with my teams and coding partners, as well as supporting each other during the inevitable roadblocks. 

- My hobbies include running, resistance training, reading, gaming and playing fetch with my favourite canine, Dori. I enjoy travelling and exploring new worlds, but to be honest, as I get deeper into my thirties, my perfect evening simply involves lounging on a sofa whilst watching a good movie with my girlfriend. -->
