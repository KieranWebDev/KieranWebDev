Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm about a student on the current School of Code Bootcamp program.

I have been an ESL Teacher for the past 8 years, working in over 6 countries. I am know looking to make a career-change into tech and am excited about the new opportunities ahead.

I'm currently learing HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as dipping my toe into React fundamentals.
