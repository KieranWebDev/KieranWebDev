## 💼 Professional Work (GitLab Contributions)  
🔒 Most of my work is in **private repositories** on **GitLab**, with over **100+ merged PRs** on production applications.  

📌 **CyberPeace Builders Platform** – Developed a **matchmaking app** that connects **NGOs with cybersecurity experts**, enabling them to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities. This automation significantly reduced manual coordination efforts, saving the **Operations team hours of work each week** while increasing expert and NGO participation.

This tool has been fully integrated into the CyberPeace Builders Platform, streamlining security evaluations and **further reducing operational workload**.
